//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);
//output = [3]

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = 'Gorilla';
console.log(animals);
//output = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Gorilla"]
//MY NOTES: The '2' inside the brackets is telling the code to put 'Gorilla' in index #2

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push = "Mouse";
console.log(animals);
//output = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant", "Mouse"]
//MY NOTES: ".push" is telling the code to add another element to the 'END' of the arrays.
    // I like to think of it as "Hey you! Add another box to the stack and PUSH it to far back."

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);
//output = 'Elephant'
//MY NOTES: This is telling the code to insert the string "Elephant" inside the index of #2

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['Pizza', 'Nacos', 'Tacos', 'Pita'];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);
//output = [4]

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push('Broccoli');
console.log(foods);
// output = ['Pizza', 'Nacos', 'Tacos', 'Pita', 'Broccoli'];

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);
//    OR
foods.pop('Broccoli');
console.log(foods);
//output = ['Pizza', 'Nacos', 'Tacos', 'Pita']

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.unshift('Lettuse', 'Beer', 'Cheese');
console.log(foods);


console.log(foods);
//output = ['Lettuse', 'Beer', 'Cheese','Pizza', 'Nacos', 'Tacos', 'Pita']

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
console.log(foods.shift());
console.log(foods.shift('Lettuse'));
//output = 'Beer', 'Cheese','Pizza', 'Nacos', 'Tacos', 'Pita']

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Chase app. = Arrays are used for listing out activity on the accout such as purchases or withdrawls.
// 2: Slack = Arrays might be used for holding the data of my direct messages and my channels.
// 3: MY HOA = (I just paid my HOA..) so they're using arrays to keep track of the payments Ive given


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15 || hasCharger === true || chargerType === 'car') {
  console.log("You can call an Uber and charge your phone!")
} else {
  console.log("You can not call an Uber")
}
//old version below.
// if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 && hasCharger === true && chargerType === 'car') {
//   console.log("Aint gonna happen 'guy', not enough juice for an Uber.")
// } else if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15 && hasCharger === true && chargerType === 'car') {
//   console.log("You can call an Uber and charge your phone!")
// }
