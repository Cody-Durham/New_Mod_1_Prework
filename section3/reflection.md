## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
**Answer**
- S.M.A.R.T. really resonated with me. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound.
This SMART technique is very structured and in a way, easy to 'check' things off the list- approach.
Another thing that I was interested in was what Ill refer to as 'fail fast & fail often' and essentially thats saying we need to learn by making mistakes. Honestly, thats a great way to learn, even though at the time of the mistake its not very enjoyable.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
**Answer**
- I lean a lot by making tons of mistakes, then fixing them. Also, repeating the task many times is a great way for me to learn. Also, I tend to not seek out as many challenges as I used to, so in trying to keep the 'Growth Mindset"
I'll have to remind myself to keep pushing when things become uncomfortable. 

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
**Answer**
- My banking app. I dont really use too many apps but Im thinking this would be one where they would use lots of arrays. Perhaps they use them for my different accounts, withdraws, deposits ect. Im sure they have my name or number stored and need to retrieve all my data thats stored in these arrays so the info can be sorted accordingly and displayed properly.   

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
**Answer**
- An array method is a format or function thats put on an array to change or manipulate that array, giving you the information your requesting.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
**Answer**
- The purpose of a loop is so we dont have to write the same block of code or function many many times (as specified).  It  will do a certain task that we can ask it to perform if we call it so it saves us (programmers) time as well as the script that the computer has to is more efficient while loading web pages.  
- We would use a loop without an array if we wanted to print something a bunch of times or have a certain type of information we could apply to a sentence like a name and want to repeat it.


1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
**Answer**
- I would explain loops like this. If you had a robot and needed to clean your room you could put your cloths in a pile, and all your toys in a pile and tell the robot to pick up those piles without having to instruct the robot to pick up every single item individually. He would pick up the "cloths" pile and also the "toys" pile.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
**Answer**
