## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it? <br>
**Answer** <br>
- It was interesting to hear how influential people "in the wild"  tend to learn. Makes sense, if you read all the time, take breaks and try to repeat what you just learned to others (or yourself), that process of repeating and understanding is what makes the content "stick." I also agree that learning is a process that shouldn't get old. Enjoy the journey, as well as the end result!

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each. <br>
**Answer** <br>
- _number_: A number is a any number (floating, whole or negative)
  _string_: Any information located inside of a set of "" or ''
  _boolean_: Returns a true/false statement
  _variable_: Is like a container for a certain word, phrase.  You are assigning certain types of values to the (container) variable

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console? <br>
**Answer** <br>
- console.log('"Hello World"');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment? <br>
**Answer** <br>
// will comment out the line of
/* */ will comment out blocks of code.
We need to add comments to code to help explain to the reader (of the code) what its for or any important information that might help them in the future.  NOTE; it shouldn't "explain" the code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old? <br>
**Answer** <br>
Is like a container or box for a certain toy.  Your putting your toy in the box, writing a name on the box so you can find it later when you want it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold? <br>
**Answer** <br>
_Google_ <br>
var signIn = "userName"; (string)
var password = true/false; (boolean)
var numberOfPagesInHistory= 100 (integer)
var themeOriginal = "whiteColor" (string)
var themeDark = "blackColor" (string)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is. <br>
**Answer** <br>
Concatenation is essentially joining things together to make a "new" (whatever). If you want to sting words & number together it would be concatention.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention? <br>
**Answer** <br>
_Google_ <br>
I think that Google uses this all the time to 'help' you search for things in the "search bar." I believe this is what the auto complete is.  Now that Im thinking about it, its probably the same with any program that uses auto complete: Atom, texting, Google, Chrome ect.  

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) <br>
**Answer** <br>
Haaaa. I would like know what the Dollar sign ($) is in JavaScript.  I believe it holds the same intent as the underscore (_) right?
